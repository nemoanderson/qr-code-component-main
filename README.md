## My process

Starting to use Mobile-first workflow but I need to check out best practices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned from [√òystein H√•berg](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Islandstone89)

Import of font
Font size, code should not be static. Read more about rem and other lenght units.

There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

#### Absolute - Fixed. 
Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)

##### Relative

Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

Unit	Description	
em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element


#### Web Font

√òystein H√•berg brought up my used of import to use Google font asked to use in thise project. My understanding was that styling be used in  CSS and avoided linking the font. I was too inexperience to know why there was a font folder in the project and have now put it together. 
Reading Stack Overflow articles are giving me more understanding and from thise point foward, I will use this new knowlege for best practices. 
One article points out that it comes down to speed and memory. When designing and developing, we are to keep the world in mind, it is the world wide web and all has access to the website. This reminds me of you are only as strong as your weakest link. I will develop as if I don't have slower speeds of internet.

Since one of my tenents is that information is power and should be free & access to computers should be for everyone, not just the welthy " information-rich"  middle classes. I will keep this in mind when designing or developing.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ');
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Need to get more familiary with Git and Github.

### Useful resources
